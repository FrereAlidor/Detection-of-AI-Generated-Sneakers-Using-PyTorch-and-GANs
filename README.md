# Detection of AI-Generated Sneakers Using PyTorch and GANs

This project focuses on detecting AI-generated images of sneakers, particularly those from popular brands like Nike, Adidas, and Converse. The dataset used includes a mix of real images sourced from Google Images and AI-generated images produced by MidJourney. The goal is to accurately distinguish between real and AI-generated images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main categories:

1. **Real Images**: These authentic images, sourced from Google Images, showcase a variety of sneaker designs from Nike, Adidas, and Converse. This part of the dataset serves as the "ground truth" for our classification tasks.

2. **AI-Generated Images**: This category includes synthetically created images using the MidJourney AI platform, as well as images generated by a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). These images mimic the styles and details of real sneakers but may include subtle imperfections or stylistic elements typical of AI-generated content.

Both categories of images are standardized to a resolution of 240x240 pixels. AI-generated images have been compressed and resized to match the dimensions of real images, ensuring consistency in the input data for model training.

## Role of GANs in This Project

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) play a key role in this project. A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator, which compete in a adversarial process. The generator creates synthetic images from random noise, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images. This process allows the generator to progressively improve the quality of the images it produces.

In this project, GANs are used for:

1. **Generating Synthetic Sneaker Images**: These images are added to the dataset to enrich the diversity of training examples.
2. **Testing the Robustness of the Detection Model**: By using GAN-generated images, we can evaluate the model's ability to distinguish real images from synthetic ones, even when the synthetic images are highly realistic.
